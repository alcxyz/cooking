# Quick Ground Beef and Vegetable Dish

A simple, flavorful, and quick-cooking ground beef and vegetable dish, perfect for a weeknight meal.

## Ingredients

*   500g (~1.1 lbs) ground beef
*   2 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 tbsp vegetable oil
*   1 tsp salt (or to taste)
*   1 tbsp paprika powder
*   1/2 onion, chopped
*   1 carrot, finely chopped into small pieces
*   2 potatoes, finely chopped into small pieces
*   1 tsp tomato paste
*   1 tomato, chopped
*   1 bell pepper, chopped
*   Fresh chives, chopped, to taste
*   Fresh parsley, chopped, to taste
*   A little ground black pepper, to taste
*   A little dried oregano, to taste
*   Optional: A little water, for desired consistency

## Preparation

1.  **Start the Base:**
    *   In a pan (or large pot/Dutch oven), heat the oil over medium heat.
    *   Add the minced garlic, salt, and paprika. SautÃ© briefly until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
    *   Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-5 minutes.

2.  **Brown the Meat:**
    *   Add the ground beef to the pan. Break it up with a spoon and brown thoroughly.
    *   Once the meat is browned, let it simmer gently with the aromatics and spices for approximately 8 minutes to deepen the flavors.

3.  **Add Initial Vegetables:**
    *   While the meat simmers, prepare the carrot and potatoes by chopping them into small pieces.
    *   Add the chopped carrot and potatoes to the pan along with the tomato paste. Stir well to combine.
    *   Cover the pan and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrot and potato start to become tender.

4.  **Add Remaining Vegetables & Finish:**
    *   Chop the fresh tomato and bell pepper.
    *   Once the carrot and potato are tender, add the chopped tomato and bell pepper to the pan. Cook for a few more minutes until they are slightly softened.
    *   To finish, sprinkle generously with fresh chopped chives, fresh chopped parsley, a little ground black pepper, and dried oregano. Stir to combine.

## Notes

*   **Consistency:** You control the consistency of the sauce. Always keep the pot covered while cooking to maintain good moisture and allow the flavors to meld. If you prefer a looser sauce, you can add a little hot water during cooking, a bit at a time, until your desired consistency is reached.
*   **Vegetable Size:** Chopping the carrot and potatoes into small pieces helps them cook faster and integrate better into the dish.
*   **Seasoning:** Adjust salt and pepper to your preference throughout the cooking process.

Enjoy! ðŸ¥°
