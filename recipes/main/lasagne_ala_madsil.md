# Generous Homemade Lasagna

A homemade lasagna recipe, packed with filling and cheese, perfect for those who like to cook in large quantities. Yields one large baking dish.

## Ingredients

*   1 package (500g / ~1.1 lbs) lasagna sheets (whole wheat or regular, your choice)
*   400g (~0.9 lbs) ground beef (14% fat)
*   800g (~1.75 lbs) minced beef/stewing beef (like for carbonnade/stew) or more ground beef
*   1 jar store-bought Bolognese sauce with garlic (e.g., Dolmio)
*   1 jar store-bought white sauce/bÃ©chamel (e.g., Dolmio)
*   1 onion, chopped (red or white)
*   1 large bell pepper, chopped
*   2 tomatoes, chopped
*   1 tsp ground black pepper
*   1 tbsp paprika powder (or `colorau`)
*   1 tbsp garlic paste OR 4 cloves garlic, minced with salt to taste
*   2 tbsp vegetable oil
*   2 packages (total ~800g / ~1.75 lbs) shredded mozzarella cheese (or another cheese that melts well)
*   3 packages (total 240-300g / ~8.5-10.5 oz) grated Parmesan cheese (ideally Parmigiano Reggiano)
*   Fresh chopped herbs (parsley and chives) to taste (`cheiro-verde`)
*   500ml (~2 cups) hot water
*   1 carton (approx. 200-300ml / ~1 cup) cooking cream (like Norwegian 'matflÃ¸te')
*   Salt to taste

## Preparation

1.  **Prepare the Meat Sauce:**
    *   In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat.
    *   Add the garlic paste (or minced garlic with salt), paprika, and black pepper. SautÃ© briefly (be careful not to burn the garlic/paprika).
    *   Add the ground beef and the minced/stewing beef. Brown the meat well, breaking it up with a spoon. Season with salt to taste.
    *   Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften.
    *   Stir in the store-bought Bolognese sauce (red Dolmio), a portion of the grated Parmesan cheese (reserve most for layering and topping), the hot water, **and the cooking cream**.
    *   Mix well, lower the heat, and simmer for about 3-5 minutes, stirring to prevent sticking. Adjust salt if needed. Stir in the fresh chopped herbs at the end.

2.  **Assemble the Lasagna:**
    *   Choose a large, deep baking dish.
    *   Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish (this prevents the pasta from sticking).
    *   Place a layer of lasagna sheets over the sauce.
    *   Cover the pasta with a generous layer of meat sauce.
    *   Sprinkle some shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the sauce.
    *   Repeat the layers: lasagna sheets, meat sauce, cheeses.
    *   **White Sauce Layer:** Alternate a layer of the store-bought white sauce (Dolmio white) between the red sauce layers. For example, if your dish allows for 4 layers of filling, place the white sauce as the third layer (pasta -> red sauce -> cheese -> pasta -> red sauce -> cheese -> pasta -> **white sauce** -> cheese -> pasta -> red sauce -> final cheese topping). Adjust based on your dish's depth.
    *   **Finishing:** End with a layer of pasta covered by meat sauce (or the remaining white sauce, if preferred) and top generously with the remaining shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.

3.  **Bake:**
    *   Preheat the oven to 180Â°C - 200Â°C (350Â°F - 400Â°F).
    *   Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (try not to let it touch the cheese).
    *   Bake for about 20-30 minutes.
    *   Remove the aluminum foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese is golden brown and gratinated.
    *   Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting and serving.

## Notes

*   **Pasta Type:** The original recipe suggests whole wheat pasta, but you can use your preferred type (no-boil, fresh, etc.). Follow package directions if necessary.
*   **Cheeses:** The cheese quantities are generous (over 1kg / 2.2 lbs total). Adjust to your taste if you prefer less cheese. The "shredded cheese" likely refers to mozzarella or a similar melting cheese.
*   **Store-Bought Sauces:** The recipe uses Dolmio brand sauces as a base. Feel free to substitute with other brands or homemade sauces.
*   **Cooking Cream:** The addition of cooking cream (`matflÃ¸te`) makes the meat sauce richer. If you can't find specific "cooking cream", you could substitute with heavy cream, but be mindful it might behave slightly differently when heated for extended periods.
*   **Yield:** This recipe makes a large lasagna, suitable for many people or for freezing.
*   **Freezing:** You can freeze the baked (and cooled) lasagna, either cut into individual portions or the whole dish. Wrap well to prevent freezer burn. To reheat, thaw in the refrigerator and heat in the oven or microwave.
*   **Adjustments:** Calculate the number of layers based on the size and depth of your baking dish.

Enjoy! ðŸ¥°
